▶️ Getting started is **easy**! Thanks to **Monolithic Clean Architecture**, everything is structured and streamlined. Plus, even though this project uses a **modern JavaScript framework like Vue.js**, it **does not require a build system**—just use Visual Studio to run and build effortlessly.  

1. Open the project using Visual Studio.  
2. Update the connection string in `appsettings.json` to match your SQL Server database.  
3. Clean and build the solution:  
   - Right-click the solution > Clean  
   - Right-click the solution > Build  
4. Run the project:  
   - Click the green "play" button in the Visual Studio toolbar.  

> **Note**: The database will be created automatically if it does not exist.  

💡 The DB auto-creates if not present.
